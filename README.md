# Convex Structures

## Install

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install the necessary packages and `npm run start` to compile and serve. This project was tested on Arch Linux and Linux Mint with npm 9.2.0 and 9.6.5, and node v19.9.0 and v20.0.0. Unfortunately, the lab machines don't have npm on them.
